MicroMusic
==========

When I think of a minimalist music player, I think of something that has a queue of music to play, plays music, and has a nice, minimal, out-of-your-way interface.

However, when I search for minimalist music players, I get things like `cmus`, `mpd` and friends, etc., which are actually kind of bloated.

So this here is my take on a truly minimalist music player. It has less than 200 lines of shell script code.
